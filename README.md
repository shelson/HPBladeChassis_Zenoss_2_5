Zenoss Community ZenPacks
-------------------------

This is the Git repository for the ZenPacks provided by the generous efforts of the [Zenoss](http://zenoss.org) Community members.  The canonical list of currently available ZenPacks is <http://community.zenoss.org/community/zenpacks>.  For a ZenPack to be listed there and included in this source tree, ZenPack developers will need to fill out the [Contribution Form](http://community.zenoss.org/community/developers), allowing Zenoss to relicense the ZenPack under the GPL and possibly eventually include it in Zenoss. 

<http://zenpacks.zenoss.org> is also available for read-only Subversion access and Trac defect-tracking.  Accounts are available by contacting <community@zenoss.com>. The Git repository is periodically resynced back to the Subversion repository.
